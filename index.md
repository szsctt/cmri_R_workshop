## What you will learn

This workshop will introduce `R` and the `tidyverse`.  The goal is to cover enough to get you started with `R`, but not for you to become an expert.

We will cover the following topics:

Session 1: Monday 5 December 2022, 1:30pm-5:30pm

 - Introduction to R and Rstudio
 - Introduction to the tidyverse
 - Reading in data with `readr` and `readxl`
 - Manipulating data with `tidyr` and `dplyr`
 - Plotting data with `ggplot2`
 
Session 2: Tuesday 6 December 2022, 2:00pm-5:30pm

 - Introduction to `bioconductor`
 - Introduction to `Rmarkdown`
 - Version control with `git`
 - Case study: peptide counts during selection


## What you will not learn

This course aims to cover a lot of ground quickly.  Inevitably, this means things are left out.  The goal of this workshop is not to teach you all the details of the material covered, but rather to teach you just enough to get you stared with using `R` for your work, and where to get help when you need it. 

During this course, you should focus on trying to learn the **concepts**, rather than the details.  For example, when we learn about functions, you should not try to memorize all the specific functions that are given as examples, but rather focus on the questions like: What is a function?  Why is it useful?

 Don't worry if you don't understand every detail - you'll become more comfortable as you start to practice.
