## `Rmarkdown` for reproducible, documented analyis

For a long time, most `R` code was written in *scripts*.  These are just plain old text files, usually with the file extension `.R`, which contain `R` code.  Any documentation in these scripts was in the form of comments, and any graphic generated had to be saved to file (or viewed in a window, then closed).

This paradigm worked, but it was lacking an integrated view of the results of the analysis.  This is the problem that `knitr` and R markdown were developed to address.

R markdown allows the user to create notebooks and documents that contain text elements (formatted using markdown), and `R` code. If I've ever sent you a `.html` document containing some results, this is what I used to generate it.  Other formats are possible for data export, including `.pdf`, but I tend to always use `.html` for it's interactive elements.

Documents you create are *rendered* into the final output format that you've specified, by running all the code and combining the outputs it with your markdown text.

Although simple, this approach is powerful; I wrote all the content on this website using R markdown documents.

### Rmarkdown header

R markdown documents always start with a header, which is formatted in [`YAML`](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/), and at it's most basic looks something like this:

```yaml
---
title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---
```

That's it: just a title and an output.

#### Output types

When you create a `.Rmd` file, you'll have to choose if you want it to be a notebook (`output: html_notebook`), a document (`output: html_document`), or some other output type (for example, `output: pdf_document`).

Notebooks and documents are very similar, and the only difference between html documents and notebooks is that a `.html` file is created with your analysis every time you save a notebook, whereas an output file will only be created for a document when you tell RStudio to render it.

If you want, you can add an author and a date, for example:

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
author: Jane Doe
date: March 22, 2005
output: html_document
---
```

Sometimes I want the date to be updated every time I render the document.  You can do this by replacing the date with some `R` code.

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
author: Jane Doe
date: <code>&grave;r Sys.Date()&grave;</code>
output: html_document
---
```

There are also lots of options for html documents and notebooks.  I often use:

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
author: Jane Doe
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  html_document:
    keep_md: true
    df_print: paged
    toc: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: false
    code_folding: hide
---
```

### Markdown elements

Writing markdown documents are pretty simple.  Use `#` for headings

```markdown
# Largest heading
## Large heading
### Medium heading
#### Small heading
```

To create paragraphs, leave at least one blank line between text.

```markdown
This is a paragph.

This is a different paragraph.
```

To add a line break (to prevent sentences from running on from one another), add two spaces at the end of the line.

```markdown
This is a line.  
This is another line.
```

To add empahsis, use `*` or `_`.

```markdown
This text is **bold**.
This text is __also bold__.
This text is in *italics*.
This text is also in _italics_.
This text is both ***bold and in italics***.
___Same here___.
```

To create a block quote, add `>` to the start of each line.


```markdown
> This will be a quote
>
> that's all in the same block
```

To make a list, use numbers or dashes.

```markdown
This is an unordered list:

 - element a
 - element b
 - element c
 
This is an ordered list:

1. element 1
2. element 2
3. element 3
 
```

If you want to display code, use backticks:

````markdown

This is `inline` code.

```r
print("this is an R code block")
```

````

To add images, use this syntax:


```markdown
![Caption for figure](/path/to/figure.png)
```

You can add links using parentheses and brackets:

```markdown
