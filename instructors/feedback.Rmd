xUsing geom_freqpoly(), make frequency polynomials of the speed of the maximum wind gust on each day for each city, using 10 bins (you might need to check the documentation). - confusingly worded

Challenge 1 is too early - or add section about how to add color


Change proportion example to:

weather %>% 
  group_by(city, wind_direction_9am) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=city, y=count, fill=wind_direction_9am)) +
  geom_col(position="fill")
  
  
colors - hexadecimal value

File.path for loading data won't work on windows - use paste0 instead

For each peptide, calculate the fraction of counts within the library in a new column called frac. - clarify 'fraction of counts within the library '

Bubble plot height=0

Typo: Add column called rank with ranks within each library, with 1 for peptide with highest fraction, 2 for peptide with second highest, and so on. in result - 'count' instead of 'counts'

Print out cheatsheets
